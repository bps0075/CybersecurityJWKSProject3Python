# Cybersecurity Project 3
## Name
* Brandon Sharp
## Goals
* With the extended JWKS server, this program will be bulked up with enhanced security and user management for the JWKS server. 
* It already generates RSA key pairs and a web server with 2 handlers (GET and POST), serves HTTP on port 8080, the JWKS Server has been extended with the help of SQL Lite to prevent malicious SQL query manipulation, ensuring our authentication processes remain resilient and trustworthy.

## Parts
First the server file would run. Next, the client file or something like gradebot or Postman can interact with the server file on port 8080. Then, the key generation occurs and a web server with 2 handlers (GET and POST) can be used. On gradebot, the report would be shown witht the total code coverage value.

## Compile (depends)
Build the project, and the run the project with JUnit involved. Something that may be neccessary is to install a certain packege if you do not have it. You can also test the code with the test cases.
